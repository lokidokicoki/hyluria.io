summary: The Swift, clearly an honourable and trustworthy individual

## Summary

Mendel is the sly one, the trickster, purloiner of unwanted items, teller of
tales and definitely the most trustworthy, oh yes. She is quick witted, capable
of great feats of sleight of hand, hiding in plain sight, cocky and has a
twinkle in her eye.

Mendel appears as a young woman of the supplicant's race and is of medium
height. She is usually seen wearing dark armour, or garish flamboyant
jester-like garb. She either carries a lute or a short bow and daggers.

## Emblem

The Eye of Mendel carved into rock signifying a nearby safe house.

## Gifts

You can see exactly where they put the trap... You can have them eating out of
your hand... Shame you can't do complex maths to calculate the cut you owe.
