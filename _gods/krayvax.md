## Summary

KrayVax is the warrior of the Six. She is the mailed fist, the patron of
Fighters and Barbarians. She is bawdy, gruffly spoken, quick to anger, quicker
to action and laughs uproariously at the coarsest jokes.

KrayVax appears as a middle aged female of the supplicant's race, tall and
impressively muscled. She is usually seen wearing a mix of armours, sometimes
studded leather, sometimes a full plate mail, and carries a variety of melee
weapons.

Ah, the trill of battle, being able to deliver that blow peerlessly, who cares
if you might get hit?
