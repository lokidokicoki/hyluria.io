## Summary

Rakshi is the healer and the philosopher, in touch with the warp and weft of the
natural world. He is the patron of clerics, druids and monks. He is
contemplative, benevolent and wise. He speaks with a warm soothing voice.

Rakshi appears as an old male of the supplicant's race and a little stooped. He
is usually seen wearing a robe, carrying a pole staff.

## Emblem

The Staff of Rakshi carved in a temple door frame.

## Gifts

The healing arts are strong, you can help more people. This interminable
weakness is surely a passing phase.
