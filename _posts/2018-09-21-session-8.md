## Date 719HE/E25

Waking in the cool dungeon was an odd experience for all party members. After a
small breakfast (which Tynwurm complained about…) the team set off into another
room, this time with a set of stairs leading further down.

The air was cooler here, the room covered in cobwebs. Our brave heroes were wary
of moving into the next corridor, and quite right too! A brief fight ensued with
three giant spiders, two of which were slain and the last was charmed by
Szithluon. Using his ability to converse with animals, they found out the spider
was female and called Regina Quirrn.

Moving further in, the team encountered a Phase Spider, which tried to put up a
fight… but no real contest.

They found in a secret room a diary written by Prekas, detailing his mad
experiments with contacting other realms, one wine and a cachet of electrum
pieces

The adventurers then explored this level under Deorcþeng. Celasar and Tynwurm
had a friendly falling out, which, for some reason, ended with Celasar capturing
one of Tynwurm's farts in a glass bottle… The root cause of the fight? Celasar
had named Tynwurm's raven, Edgar Allan Crow…

Having been on the move for some hours, the team moved to the room they had
fought the Phase Spider in and set up camp for lunch.
