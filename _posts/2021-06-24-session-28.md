- Ninny G can make out spell-flare in the dust, and the more keen sighted can see a humanoid figure being set up by a group of smaller beings. 
- On arrival at the scene, the heroes see a human dress in slightly tatty robes trying hold off a group of 5 kobolds, surrounded by another 5 kobold bodies.
- The group reluctantly assists in dealing with the kobolds, who are no match for the band.
- The human introduces himself as Luas, an Erilean. NinnyG sense there is magic about this individual. 
- When asked why the kobolds were attacking him, Luas explains they were unhappy about some anti-magic medallions he had sold them.
- Ulunuuh (?) finds one of these medallions, which when held in the hand starts to get uncomfortably hot!
- The group help Luas find the rest of the medallions, and then continue their journey to Faf!nyr with Luas in tow.
