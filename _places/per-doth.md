title: Per^doth
summary: The southern capital of Be^lash
---

Elegant towers and low softly shaped bungalows made of a iridescent olive green
material shimmer in the sunlight. The willowy towers seem to move in the wind
like treesâ€¦ But _obviously_ that can't be.

The dun^n (fortress) is the southern capital of Be^lash, situated close to the
Zr^nbel Steps, the mountain range that leads into the eastern ocean.

## Demographics

Total population: 15,000

- 80% ^truar - Mainly Silva^truar
- 15% Urman
- 5% other

## Layout

The dun^n forms a diamond shape, marked by a line of trees. Everywhere in
Per^doth is neat, tidy, and artful.

The streets are broad, but not paved. The sweet scent of citrus comes from trees
that have planted, or at least encouraged, to grow along the boulevards.

Lilting music can be heard on the breeze. This is a place of calm.

At the centre of the dun^n are six towers, arranged around an circular open air
meeting ground.

There is no formal organisation of the dun^n, apart from the central towers.
Shops and temples are intermingled with markets and houses, libraries and
galleries, theatres and eateries.

All the ^truar speak impeccable Urman, Ur'Kun, Zwerg and passable Drache.

There are hostels to stay at. Storytelling, musical and poetry recitals.

Outside the dun^n are martial training grounds, only occasionally used.
