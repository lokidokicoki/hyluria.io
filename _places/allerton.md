The heavily fortified city of Allerton is a relic of the War of the Nehwist. Originally built to hold off the ^truar forces during the war, the focus of the city has shifted somewhat to trade and commerce and is now the third largest city in Hylur. 

The city boasts impressive walls and defensive towers guarding the original fortress that lies at the centre.

## Demographics
Total population ~10,000
- 70% Urman
- 15% ^truar
- 10% UR'ku and Khob'linn
- 5% other (Zwerg, Drache'zin)

## Layout

The city is split into six Hexants, each dedicated to one of the Six. A ring road separates the inner fortress and wards from the outer wards and the walls.

The entrances into the city are through arches in the walls. The walls themselves are much thicker than those of the Imperial City. The hub-bub of a lively city rolls over you. Less busy than the Imperial City. The city guard here are more heavily armed and armoured that in the Imperial City.

Above all the noise you hear a cry of 'Kebab on a stick, rabbit rissoles in a bun, honest meat patties!'
Thin man, with a tray of mystery delights round his neck. Front is covered in grease. 
'Selling meself short' Grabbler, "and that's selling meself short!"

### The Outer wards
Mainly housing, small shops selling food and essentials. People who live here work in the larger shops or outside in the farms attached to the city. Small temples to the Six 
The Inner wards
Only slightly different to the outer wards, more shops and street markets, and a medium temple to the dedicated Six exists in each. None of the shops sell "high" magic items; all but very rare items can be found.

### The Fortress

The Fortress is split into 6 sections with a central meeting hall, granite slabs pave the floor, tapestries depicting battle victories line the walls. Weak light comes through the arrow slit windows, supplemented by many torches. A large hexagonal table dominates the hall.

## Leadership

Baron Felix Harkin, Praetor Jeremiah Torquill and Andraste Casilltenirra are seated at the table discussing the affairs of the day.

Baron Felix Harkin: mid 40's powerful build, 6'4" warrior diplomat, carousing
Praetor Jeremiah Torquill: late 70's wheezy, intelligent but sometimes slow on the uptake
Andraste Casilltenirra: 210, aloof but pleasant, quiet.
