<em>The ^Truar are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. The ^Truar love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</em>

-- Taken from "The Races of the Spinwards Marches" by Scholar Av^urel Lor^kas, -13HE.

The ^Truar (or 'Elves' in Common) Have been forced to the margins of the Spinwards Marches; Be^lash in the East and the Kal^verthian Forest in the North. They still travel the world, enclaves exist in most of the larger cities and towns throught Hylur.
