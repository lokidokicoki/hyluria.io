<em>"Urmans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.
Whatever drives them, Urman are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers
of the worlds."</em>

\-- Taken from "The Races of the Spinward Marches" by Scholar Av^urel Lor^kas,
\-13HE.

The Urman (or 'Human' in Common) came late to Spinward Marches arriving on the
coast of [Be^lash](/geography/belash) in the year -505HE, long after the Great
Scourge and the War of Annihilation.

After the unfortunate War of the Nehwist between the Urman and the ^Truar, the
Urman have finally established their Empire and turned to more peaceful
pursuits.

They have settled the following lands:

- [Tandive](/geography/tandive)
- [Erilea](/geography/erilea)
- [Hyluria](/geography/hyluria)
- [Mro'Gabtak belt](/geography/mrogabtak-belt)
