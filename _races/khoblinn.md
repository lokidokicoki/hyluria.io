<em>"Khob'Linn are small, black-hearted humanoids that lair in despoiled
dungeons and other dismal settings. Individually weak, they gather in large
numbers to torment other creatures."</em>

\-- Taken from "The Races of the Spinward Marches" by Scholar Av^urel Lor^kas,
\-13HE.

Traditionally the indentured servants of the [Ur'Ku](/races/urku), the
relationship between the Khob'Linn (or 'Goblin' in Common) and the Ur'Ku has
evolved from a slave caste to if not equal, then at least approaching equal,
worker class.
